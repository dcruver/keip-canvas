This is an automagical process in which bean references don\u0027t need to be coded explicitly in the XML bean definition file, but rather the Spring container works out dependencies. The effective default is \"no\". There are 4 modes: 1. \"no\" The traditional Spring default. No automagical wiring. Bean references must be defined in the XML file via the \u003cref/\u003e element (or \"ref\" attribute). We recommend this in most cases as it makes documentation more explicit. Note that this default mode also allows for annotation-driven autowiring, if activated. \"no\" refers to externally driven autowiring only, not affecting any autowiring demands that the bean class itself expresses. 2. \"byName\" Autowiring by property name. If a bean of class Cat exposes a \"dog\" property, Spring will try to set this to the value of the bean \"dog\" in the current container. If there is no matching bean by name, nothing special happens. 3. \"byType\" Autowiring if there is exactly one bean of the property type in the container. If there is more than one, a fatal error is raised, and you cannot use byType autowiring for that bean. If there is none, nothing special happens. 4. \"constructor\" Analogous to \"byType\" for constructor arguments. If there is not exactly one bean of the constructor argument type in the bean factory, a fatal error is raised.
